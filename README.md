This script will use the text-to-speech features of Windows to recite the lyrics to the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas."

The easiest way to run this script is to copy the raw content to the clipboard, open a Powershell prompt, and just paste the script into the prompt. (You might have to hit **ENTER** an extra time or two. )

The results will vary, depending on how your installation of Windows and the text-to-speech subsystem is configured.  Mine sounds kind of like Captain Kirk.
